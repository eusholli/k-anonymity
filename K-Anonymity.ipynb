    "## Introduction to K-Anonymity\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction looks at k-anonymity, a privacy model commonly applied to protect the data subjects’ privacy in data sharing scenarios, and the guarantees that k-anonymity can provide when used to anonymise data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sharing data is a very important decision to take. It is impossible to get data back once shared and liabilities can be tremendously high, especially if the data being shared can be used to identify individuals and lead to a loss of privacy. You may have tried really hard to anonymize the data being released but legal organizations want to trust more than your word. K-anonymity serves that need by providing one mechanism to quantify the risk contained in any released dataset, it moves the conversation from subjective opinion to factual basis."

    "## The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City has asked Elite Cars to provide their passenger trip records, so they can run their own analysis.  Anonymity is of paramount importance to your customers and to the core promise and identity of the company.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset has been created that has stripped out unecessary trip data such as tips and links to driver details and passenger details. But the request has asked for the home address, gender and age of the passengers using the service, where they are going from and to, and at what times.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge in this living lab is to use K-Anonymity to interrogate this dataset and understand the level of risks and concerns that may exist. We are going to do this whole process manually so we can feel what is involved and what needs consideration. In the real world, there are machine learning algorithms that will help you achieve your wanted K-Anonymity values.\n",

    "We are going to use python for this exercise since python has many libraries for supporting large datasets such as pandas and numpy, all packaged by [scipy.org](https://scipy.org).  We are not going to do anything advanced so we hope you can follow along and focus on the k-anonymization aspects even if you are not a regular python coder.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The first thing we are going to do is examine each data field type for specificity versus \"needed\" specificity. Anonymizing datasets is a balance between the analysis wanting to be performed versus the level of detail held within the dataset.  In this case, we do not specifically know the precise details of the reasons why the data is being requested, which can be common in the real world as well.  It is not unusual for a negotiation to take place between wanted interest of the receiver versus risk analysis from the provider.  This is why mathematical analysis of the data to score anonymity in a quantified way is such a powerful concept. There is no judgement, just decisions about risk versus need.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this live lab, we shall look at each different field, present possible alternatives, and in our case here, make some arbitary decisions on which we initially choose, so we can then run further mechanisms to hit the k-anonymity numbers wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at datasets, it is important to understand perspective and context can radically change the dangers of any dataset.  The data we are using is all located in the NY area, with very precise date, time and location information. Mapping the location data and correlating the timing with known events in the city could, for example, give a much smaller population of interest. For example, if a film festival is taking place, it can be seen who is traveling to the film festival. We have their home zip codes, sex and date of birth. We can quickly identify which journeys are those taken by famous film stars, where and when they were going to different places not correlated to the film festival, and how often.  Anonymous data has quickly changed into highly focused source of knowledge. Using a similar technique, rather than starting with the dataset let us start with the known home address of a famous film actor, and see if that location is either at the start and/or end of any journeys. You can see by using other public information, the data that we currently have in this dataset can be used to identify people very quickly.  The exact inverse of what is needed by Elite Cars.\n",

    "- The tens digit gives a position to about 1,000 kilometers. It gives us useful information about what continent or ocean we are on.\n",
    "- The units digit (one decimal degree) gives a position up to 111 kilometers (60 nautical miles, about 69 miles). It can tell us roughly what large state or country we are in.\n",
    "- The first decimal place is worth up to 11.1 km: it can distinguish the position of one large city from a neighboring large city.\n",
    "- The second decimal place is worth up to 1.1 km: it can separate one village from the next.\n",
    "- The third decimal place is worth up to 110 m: it can identify a large agricultural field or institutional campus.\n",
    "- The fourth decimal place is worth up to 11 m: it can identify a parcel of land. It is comparable to the typical accuracy of an uncorrected GPS unit with no interference.\n",
    "- The fifth decimal place is worth up to 1.1 m: it distinguish trees from each other. Accuracy to this level with commercial GPS units can only be achieved with differential correction.\n",
    "- The sixth decimal place is worth up to 0.11 m: you can use this for laying out structures in detail, for designing landscapes, building roads. It should be more than good enough for tracking movements of glaciers and rivers. This can be achieved by taking painstaking measures with GPS, such as differentially corrected GPS.\n",
    "- The seventh decimal place is worth up to 11 mm: this is good for much surveying and is near the limit of what GPS-based techniques can achieve.\n",
    "- The eighth decimal place is worth up to 1.1 mm: this is good for charting motions of tectonic plates and movements of volcanoes. Permanent, corrected, constantly-running GPS base stations might be able to achieve this level of accuracy.\n",
    "- The ninth decimal place is worth up to 110 microns: we are getting into the range of microscopy. For almost any conceivable application with earth positions, this is overkill and will be more precise than the accuracy of any surveying device.\n",
    "- Ten or more decimal places indicates a computer or calculator was used and that no attention was paid to the fact that the extra decimals are useless. Be careful, because unless you are the one reading these numbers off the device, this can indicate low quality processing!\n",

    "Pickup and dropoff times are precise down to the second of pickup and dropoff.  This seems unnecessarily detailed again whatever the analysis.  We could choose to group all trips taken per minute, per hour, per day.  We could drop the date completely and just have a 0-23 bucket structure. This could be a good example of where negotiation is required, depending on what kinds of analysis the city wants to run, balanced against the granularity and specificity of the data that can be released and maintain anonymity.  If we look at the dataset we can see all trips were taken in the month of January 2015, so we already have a high density and frequency of trips over date in this dataset.  We shall choose to group trips that were started in the same hour. We shall do the same for the Dropoff time. "
