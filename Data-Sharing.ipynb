Working with data and anonymizing data is a growing essential skill that has to be learned as well as applied. To fully understand and benefit from this workbook, take the [course](https://dataprotocol.com/), read the [book](https://www.manning.com/books/privacy-engineering), and get certified!\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction looks at common data sharing techniques introduced in the course, applied in code and with data. One is k-anonymity, a privacy model commonly applied to protect data subjects’ privacy in data sharing scenarios, and the guarantees that k-anonymity can provide when used to anonymise data. Another is l-diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharing data is a very important decision to take. It is impossible to get data back once shared and liabilities can be tremendously high, especially if the data being shared can be used to identify individuals and lead to a loss of privacy. You may have tried really hard to anonymize the data being released but legal organizations want to trust more than your word. K-anonymity serves that need by providing one mechanism to quantify the risk contained in any released dataset, it moves the conversation from subjective opinion to factual basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset comes represents trips taken in New York during the month of January 2015. We will be looking at thousands of rides with very rich data attached.  This dataset in entirety should never be released externally since re-identification would be easy.  Inside the dataset there are four columns that represent where each ride has a pickup location and a drop off location. For each location, we will vary the number of decimal points in their GPS coordinates so that we can provide that same location with varying degrees of precision. Based on this variation in precision, we will see how many other rides meet the same criteria and what the associated privacy values are.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing the Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use python for this exercise since python has many libraries for supporting large datasets such as pandas and numpy, all packaged by [scipy.org](https://scipy.org).  We are not going to do anything advanced so we hope you can follow along and focus on the privacy aspects even if you are not a regular python coder.  We have designed the code so even if you are not an expert, you should be able to play with the varying input criteria and see the effects on output.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is necessary to execute each line of the code starting from the top of the workbook.  You can re-execute individual cells after changing the contained code if wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first import the main libraries we will be using - pandas and numpy.  This makes working with large datasets very easy. We then load in the master trip dataset that our engineers have generated for us."

    "- The sixth decimal place is worth up to 0.11 m: you can use this for laying out structures in detail, for designing landscapes, building roads. It should be more than good enough for tracking movements of glaciers and rivers. This can be achieved by taking painstaking measures with GPS, such as differentially corrected GPS.\n",
